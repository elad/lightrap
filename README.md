# Lightrap

Lightrap is an experimental bug tracker. It has an API-first design (exposes a RESTful interface) and plugins inspired by [Haraka](https://haraka.github.io/).

Example plugins:

  * [GNATS](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnats/) handling for incoming PRs
  * Mention support with cross-project notifications
